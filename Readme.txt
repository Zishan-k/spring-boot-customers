1) I've made the project using springboot and H2 database connection
	so, for that i've intsalled h2 database engine and configure it with eclipse project 
	in application.properties file.

2) To insert the data I've used Postman(for data entry) which takes the URL and then I've provided the data in JSON format and send it.

3) The sent data is now Shown in h2-console after successfull connection that has to be made first.

4) So, we can perform CRUD operatoins in the postman which will be also shown in the h2-console.




5) response code 406 error was showing while accessing the API that was given question Doc.
 	So, I've used an extra table Customer  and less columns from the product.json
